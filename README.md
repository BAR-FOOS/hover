# HOVER ðŸ›¸
A floating notepad in your browser

Hover is a half-finished experiment in spatial note-taking. You can install the Hover Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover/lepdeghhgnfgndhbhhgjmgdggikibcca?hl=en&authuser=0).

Key Features
* Launches on top of any webpage, slightly translucent so you can still read what's under the notepad
* Resize and move the notepad anywhere
* Whenever you select text on the webpage, it automatically copies the text to the notepad (after a slight pause) as "quoted text"

TODO:
* Save! Right now this is client side only, and nothing is saved anywhere.
* Basic Windowing logic (right now hover just stacks one on top of another, without any limits)
* Resize and Moving is a bit buggy: I think most of this just needs to be rewritten (currently using interactjs.io)

I don't have time to work on this anymore but if anyone wants to take over, feel free to fork. Not watching PR's.
